Heroku Automated deployment of master: https://toynet-react.herokuapp.com/

Changes made in package.json related to the Heroku deployment (specifically the creation of `server.js`) have made it so that `npm start` no longer brings up the react development server. To run the React development server, run `npm run dev` or `npm run-script dev`.

-------------------------------------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
* `npm run dev` - Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
* `npm start` - Runs the app from build. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
* `npm test` - Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
* `npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
